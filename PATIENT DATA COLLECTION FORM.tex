\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{Data collection in hospitals is one of the most important aspect that provides guidelines towards patient treatment and  and registration.}
\paragraph{Ideally everything begins with registering a patient in a hospital and most important data about the patient is collected at this stage.}
\paragraph{This makes paper work too much (registration form for each patient) and therefore necessitates a large collection space where all the files are to be kept.}

\section{Statement of the problem}
\paragraph{Patient registration of one of the most paper work producing process in that each patient to be admitted to the hospital has to be registered.This creates need for more room where these registration forms are to kept safely for future reference}
\paragraph{In a way of curbing this down electronic forms can be used in order to reduce on the hospital's expenses for example labor (those responsible for data entry into the hospital's system)}

\section{Data to be collected}
\paragraph{Patient's name is very vital so as to know who the patient is.} 
\paragraph{Date on which the patient is registered in the hospital is also crucial.}
\paragraph{The patient's face/picture is highly essential.} 
\paragraph{Patient's location where the patient lives is also needed.}
\paragraph{Patient's contact.}
\paragraph{Date of birth of the patient.}
\paragraph{Marital status of the patient.}
\paragraph{Occupation of the patient .}
\paragraph{Next of kin to the patient.}
\paragraph{Next of kin's relationship with the patient.}
\paragraph{Next of kin's contact.}
\paragraph{Previous doctor of the patient for security purposes.}
\paragraph{Previous doctors address such that he can be contacted by the new doctor at the hospital.}
\paragraph{A video clip showing the patient's current condition before registration.}
\paragraph{Patient's life insurance status and the company if at all he/she is insured.}

\section{conclusion}
\paragraph{Electronic form would reduce a lot of paper work since the data would be sent directly to the hospital's databases immediately the form is filled.}
